-- This file consists of queries to be run before processing of any block.
-- Generally would consist of 
--     * inserting entries for identities such as Alice, Bob etc. or any such entry that would be used as an attribute for any entity and is not created in any block
--     * Adding default block -1 in order to map any pre-populated entity

-- NOTE - This file would only be executed when NODE_ENV is set to local

--Insert a default block
